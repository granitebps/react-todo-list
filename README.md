## To Do List App React

This is my first application using React.js. This is a simple to-do list application. This application has the functionality to Create, read, update and delete a to-do list. This is a pure react.js application. No backend, and for the data, I save it in localStorage. The reference of this application is from a YouTube video. The link is down below. Big thanks for the creator
